In order to get comprehensive view of the whole program,
It'is strongly recommended that you finish reading the first three of the following tips carefully


Tips:
1.How to get proper compilation?
    This programming is implemented in Language Java.Directory 'conference' contains the relative Java Source Code.
    In order to get proper and exact compilation,
    please use any available Java IDE with Java compiler attached and place the directory 'conference' into the Source Root.
    So at first, you have to create a Java Project of your own



2.How to run the whole program
    After the directory 'conference' is well placed.You well see the whole package hierarchy,
    in which 'conference' is at the first layer.Then you well see two Text Files,
    one named 'task_input_file.txt' and used for input,
    another named 'track_output_file.txt' and used for result output(Here, don't hurry to check this file)
    which is generated by running the program through the exit- The main function of 'TestMain'
    Right, TestMain is how you can run across the whole program chain


3.How to find the result output?
    As previously mentioned, file 'task_input_file.txt' is for result output.
    But here, after running the whole program, you have find it in the Classpath where there is file with
    the same nameâ€”'task_input_file.txt'


4.How to test the validaty of the whole programming against the supplied data?
     As previously mentioned,file 'task_input_file.txt' is for input,
     so you can reorder the task or add some other task and disorganize them,
     afterwards, run the whole program again and then you will see that in each track,
     the time of both its morning and afternoon session are fully distributed for every single task
     under the condition that is described in the email, shown as following:

            1.The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
            2.Each session contains multiple talks.
            3.Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish before 12 noon, for lunch.
            4.Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
            5.The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
            6.No talk title has numbers in it.
            7.All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
            8.Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.
